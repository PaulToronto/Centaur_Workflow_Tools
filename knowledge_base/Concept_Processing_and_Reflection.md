# Architecture: The Roles of `processing` and `reflection`

While `notebooks` and `knowledge_base` are the core of the Centaur V2 system, the `processing` and `reflection` folders provide stability for complex projects.

## ⚙️ 1. `processing/` (The Engine Room)

**Purpose:** Storage for heavy logic, data cleaning pipelines, and reusable Python modules.

### The Problem it Solves
Jupyter Notebooks are excellent for **exploration** but poor for **engineering**.
*   Notebooks with 1,000+ lines of code are hard to read.
*   Defining the same helper function in 5 different notebooks leads to copy-paste errors.

### When to use it
*   **Refactoring:** Once a function in a notebook works perfectly, move it to a `.py` file in `processing/`.
*   **ETL Jobs:** Scripts that just take raw data and clean it (no visualization needed) belong here.

### How to use it in a Notebook
To import modules from this folder into `notebooks/`, you often need to add the parent directory to the path:

```python
import sys
import os

# Add the project root to system path
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('..'))

from processing import my_cleaner_script

df = my_cleaner_script.run()
```

## 🪞 2. `reflection/` (The Captain's Log)

**Purpose:** Storage for project meta-data, automated history, and human insights.

### The Problem it Solves
Code tells you *what* happened. It doesn't tell you *why* you made those decisions or *what failed* along the way.

### Sub-folders
*   **`logs/`**: Automated logs generated by the `create_centaur_project.sh` scripts. Proof of when the project started.
*   **(Optional) `post_mortems/`**: If a project fails or a model performs poorly, write a "Post-Mortem" here explaining why, so you don't make the same mistake in the next project.
*   **(Optional) `planning/`**: Roadmaps, todo lists, or non-technical brainstorming.

### The Philosophy
This is the **Black Box Flight Recorder** for your project. If you revisit a project after 2 years, check `reflection/` first to understand the context.
