# Centaur V2: The User Manual

**Role:** The Operating System for Human-AI Collaboration.
**Philosophy:** Separate the *Execution* (Code) from the *Memory* (Concepts).

---

## 🏗 The Project Anatomy

Every Centaur Project follows this strict anatomy. Understanding "where things go" is the key to organization.

### 🧠 1. The Memory Brain
*Files that store concepts, learning, and reference material.*

- **`knowledge_base/`**
    - **What goes here:** Summaries of chats, PDF cheat sheets, design docs, "How-to" guides.
    - **Why:** If you delete all your code tomorrow, this folder should still teach you *how* to rebuild it.
    - **Tool:** Use `import_knowledge.sh` to fill this.

### ⚡️ 2. The Execution Brain
*Files that do work, run logic, and process data.*

- **`notebooks/`**
    - **What goes here:** Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`).
    - **Naming Convention:** `01_Data_Prep.ipynb`, `02_Modeling.ipynb` (Numbered for sequence).
- **`generated_assets/`**
    - **What goes here:** Raw Python scripts (`.py`) or JSON configs generated by AI that you haven't integrated yet.
- **`processing/`**
    - **What goes here:** Heavy python modules or ETL scripts if you graduate beyond notebooks.

### 🌊 3. The Data Flow
- **`inputs/`**
    - **Status:** Read-Only.
    - **Content:** Raw CSVs, zips, Kaggle datasets.
    - **Git:** Ignored automatically (to prevent bloating the repo).
- **`outputs/`**
    - **Status:** Write-Only.
    - **Content:** Cleaned CSVs, model binaries (`.pkl`), submission files.

### 🪞 4. The Mirror (`reflection/`)
- **`reflection/logs/`**: Automated logs from the setup scripts. Use this folder to also store "Post-Mortem" notes if a project fails.

## 🎮 The Workflow Loops

### Loop A: The "Learning" Loop (New Concept)
1.  **Ask** Gemini/AI to explain a topic.
2.  **Download** the summary/explanation.
3.  **Import** it: `./scripts/import_knowledge.sh <Project> <File> "Topic_Name"`

### Loop B: The "Coding" Loop (Daily Work)
1.  **Start:** `./scripts/pull_colab_notebooks.sh <Project>` (Get latest from Cloud).
2.  **Work:** Edit notebooks locally or in Colab.
3.  **Monitor:** `./scripts/watch_workflow.sh <Project>` (Optional, watches for changes).
4.  **End:** `./scripts/push_colab_notebooks.sh <Project>` (Save to Cloud).

### Loop C: The "Safety" Loop (Version Control)
1.  **Backup:** `./scripts/sync_to_drive.sh <Project>` (Backs up non-notebook files).
2.  **Commit:** `./scripts/commit_local.sh <Project> "Work description"`
3.  **Push:** `./scripts/push_to_github.sh <Project>`
